## Harris Johnson and Souder (2013)

Discussion Questions 

- Can you see yourself employing a model-theoretic lens in your work?

- Is this view consistent with our research "principles"?  

## Harris Johnson and Souder (2013)

Key Points

- Empirical research can build theory without changing theoretical claims by building models that graft, contextualize, and repurpose **representational models**: synthesizing general models / theories with aspects of the real world **from which hypotheses can be derived** [@harris2013, p. 445]

- Figure 1 provides a nice worked example of how we can traverse from a particular phenomenon to a theory and back

## Chamberlin (1965)

> The effort is to bring up into view every rational explanation of new phenomena, and to develop every tenable hypothesis respecting their cause and history. The investigator thus becomes the parent of
a family of hypotheses: and, by his parental relation to all, he is forbidden to fasten his affections unduly upon any one. 
[@chamberlin1965, p. 756]

## Chamberlin (1965)

Discussion Questions 

- How would you actually implement the method of [multiple working hypotheses](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/84yp9sqpmjb8mr4nl5pya/Chamberlin-1965-176787.pdf?rlkey=hxmie5rypyprzklobb3viz3zn&dl=0) in your work?

- Where might our discussion of "thinking about thinking" (Bayesian and sketpical thinking) help or hurt us in its application?  

## Chamberlin (1965)

> Fertility in processes is also the natural outcome of the method. Each hypothesis suggests its own criteria, its own means of proof, its own methods of developing the truth; and if a group of hypotheses encompass the subject on all sides, the total outcome of means and of methods is full and rich. 
[@chamberlin1965, p. 765]

## Chamberlin (1965)

Key Points 

- While a particular theory focuses our attention when designing a study, we should not be blinded to alternative explanations 

- Alternative explanations should be "baked into" a study and given due consideration

- Discriminating evidence is needed to distinguish between multiple plausible theories

## Pearl (2010)

Discussion questions

- I know this was dense, what did you get out of this paper?

- Based on this paper, what is necessary to make a causal claim?

## Pearl (2010)

![](assets/Pearl 2010b.png)

## Pearl (2010)

Key points

- Models can be represented using **directed acyclic graphs** 

- The effects do not need to be linear in nature (but it is often nicer to talk about the linear case and generalize)

- To determine if an estimated effect is causal, the graph must meet certain criteria such as the back-door criteria (e.g., {W1, Z3})

- Experimental designs allow for a "do X" operation which make identification easier

# Lecture - Hypotheses and models

## Hypotheses: A method for accumulating knowledge

> Knowledge accumulates through refining the theoretical statements at the top of the diagram, but it also accumulates as scholars cobble to- gether a better understanding of reality (Cart- wright, 1999) by improving their ability to de- velop and use representational models. Empirical support for hypotheses derived from a representational model demonstrates the use- fulness of that model in the proscribed context. [@harris2013, p. 447]

## Hypotheses: A foundational element

Given that hypotheses are so fundamental to model building, you would expect that I would have given you a reading about how to write them, right?

Despite trying, I could not find a great one - the best I could find (drawn upon below is @neuman2014 in concert with @pearl2001 - both books)

## Hypotheses: Some desiderata

![Selected desiderata](assets/desiderata for hypotheses.png)

## Hypotheses: Some anti-criteria

![Selected anti-criteria](assets/anti-criteria for hypotheses.png)

## Models: Styles of construction

- Verbal theorizing: the standard method employed by most papers

- Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): becoming more common, even if the logic is operating in the background

- Formal theory: use varies significantly by discipline

- Subtle point: ***Each relationship in a model   is technically a hypothesis***; you elect to focus on certain relationships of interest (e.g., the novel ones)


## Progressing your final project: Building a model 

This week's readings should help start launching you on a trajectory to convert your research question into a **model** with associated **hypotheses**

These hypotheses are often one of three flavors:

1. Tests of relationships between constructs that you intend to perform (the standard empirical paper strategy)

2. Relationships that are implied by a theoretical system that can be tested in the future (these are often called propositions)

3. Assertions of the existance of a particular construct or mechanism (this is often the point of a qualitative piece)

**Given the nature of this class, my preference is (1)**

## Preparation for next workshop

> During our second in-person meeting, we will have another workshop session about four hours long. For the first two hours or so, **students will make a five-minute presentation about the draft model that they will examine for their dissertation work that builds upon their research topic/idea.** Again, this can involve a few PowerPoint slides to help guide the discussion. This will be graded by the presence or absence of your preparation for this session. The balance of the workshop will be group work to discuss and advance those research questions, where I will move from group to group to facilitate discussions.

## Hypotheses: Extracting knowledge from observations

> Bhaskar (2008) distinguishes between the domains of the real, actual, and empirical. The real domain consists of generative mechanisms, which refer to ‘the ways of acting of things’ (Bhaskar, 2008: 14).4 Through enabling or preventing change, mecha- nisms give rise to events in the actual domain. Some events are experienced, and some are not. The empirical domain is made up of events expe- rienced through direct or indirect observation [@miller2011, p. 144]
