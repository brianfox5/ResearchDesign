# Skills corner

## Strategic note taking for scholarly articles

- Note taking and reading are two sides to the same coin in scholarly work

- Typically note taking / highlighting happens in the 'later' passes of reading, once a applicability threshold is reached

- Pro tip 1: As soon as you think a paper has any relevance, download it in annotable format and start taking notes!

- Pro tip 2: Develop a system for organizing your notes and stick with it! [An example](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/96tbv80c7ccqt72djlbj7/Project-Paper-Summaries-Images-Only.pdf?rlkey=0pd3m93l8rn8av64fdnkfu541&dl=0)

## OK - what notes should I take?

- Narrowly

  - Your interpretation of what the paper is about
  
  - Key claims of the paper and their support (or not)
  
  - Connections you noticed to other papers and ideas
  
  - The 5Cs of the paper, the parts you could follow, and what you agree with (or not)
  
  - As I get on in this business, I tend to highlight and notate less
  
## OK - what notes should I take?

- Broadly: 

  - Citations related to key ideas and passages to chase down later
  
  - Methods and measures used that could be useful in future

  - Theories and constructs that you want to learn more about 
  
  - Synonyms for terms that are important to you
  
  - The logic and supporting argumentation for key claims raised
  
  - Stylistic elements and ways of organizing a paper that you like

# Grounding

## Building a toolbox of practices

- The building blocks of an article - The 5Cs

- The building blocks of a design - The MIR Framework

- The building blocks of a study - What to do before collecting data

- The building blocks of a contribution - Two complementary perspectives

Discussion Questions 

- Why might this method be effective?  When might this approach hinder, rather than help, exposition?  

- How does this align with the lessons of the [Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516#:~:text=Barbara%20Minto%20reveals%20that%20the,to%20read%20and%20comprehend%20it)?

- Is this the way the research process must unfold?

## Tobi and Kampen (2018)

Research design: the methodology for interdisciplinary research framework.

> The MIR framework also introduces an agenda: the research team needs to carefully think through different parts of the design of their study before starting its execution (Fig. 1). First, the team discusses the conceptual design of their study which contains the ‘why’ and ‘what’ of the research. Second, the team discusses the technical design of the study which contains the ‘how’ of the research. Only after the team agrees that the complete research design is sufficiently crystalized, the execution of the work (including fieldwork) starts. (p. 1211)

Discussion Questions 

- Does the figure help to put the various elements of research design in context?

- Do you need to perform all of these steps?  Which are essential (if any)?

## Aguinis and Vandenberg (2014)

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: improving research quality before data collection.

> The suggestions offered here are motivated by our combined experience as past journal editors, associate editors, and editorial board members. We noted, sadly, that the majority of manuscripts not accepted for publication after traversing the peer-review process could have actually been rejected before the data were collected. The problems with the majority of rejected manuscripts are related to theory, research design, and/or measurement. Rarely are data analyses grounds for rejection because weak analyses can often be fixed if all of the other components are strong. (p 1.2)

Discussion Questions 

- Tell me one recommendation that resonated with you and why. 

- When might the data collection be sufficiently compelling that it would stand in contraposition to the quote on the previous slide?  Are such situations rare?

# Lecture - Practices

## Practices you can use

- The MIR framework - The space of design choices and how they interrelate

- An ounce of prevention - Or how to avoid a wasted data collection effort

- The 5Cs - The introduction as a basis for paper development

- The contribution - And its dependence upon the other practices

## The fountainhead - Research questions

- What is the "starting point" of the MIR framework?

- How can increase the confidence that we are tackling a theoretical or practical problem?

- How might the 5Cs help to iteratively identify or articulate a research question?


## Consensus creating or shifting research

## Crafting research questions using the 5Cs

![](assets/Class 3 Figure 2.png)

## What are our desiderata for "good" research questions?

Let's go back through our last three classes!

- Principles: 

  - Knowledge-accruing: Falsifiable / has falsifiable implications
  
  - Useful: Applicable / advances theoretical understanding
  
  - Generalizable: Replicable / not an ad hoc, one off, "just so" story
  
  - Answerable: Conclusion reachable through defensible logical pathways
  
## What are our desiderata for "good" research questions?

Let's go back through our last three classes!

- Positions: 

  - To what end? Theoretical v. practical knowledge

  - By doing what? How much work required to obtain precision / realism / generality?

  - With whom? Who cares about the answer?

  - Means of advance? Does the answer give rise to a novel knowledge claim?
  
## What makes a good research question **for today's purposes**?

1. Feasibility: Can it be answered with a series of 1-3 papers?  
 
2. Personal interest: Is it a question that you want to know the answer to? 

<!--- incorporate material from 11/4/23 Tatiana lecture when I get the chance --->


## Next class

I will have the first concept check posted to Brightspace before next class.

It is super simple, about 10 questions based on our discussions so far.

You will have one hour to complete the assessment once started (plenty of time)!
