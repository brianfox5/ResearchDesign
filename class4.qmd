## A gradual shift in focus

Whereas the first three weeks entailed really broad discussions of the readings, I will start drawing out some specific items for us to talk about in the readings

This is not to suppress all of the other interesting parts of the papers; rather, it is because I will want to rely or build upon specific points in the weeks to come

Going forward, we may have one or two questions to warm up our discussion of the paper, and then we can dive into some key elements

## Bacharach (1989)

Key Points 

- Falsifiability, modes of inference (logical adequacy), explanatory potential - it's all here! 

- Brings to the foreground the idea of a **set of relationships between ideas**

- Emphasis placed on generalizability across contexts and explanatory potential


## Johns (2006)

## Johns (2006)

Discussion Questions 

- Did this paper resonate after what we have seen so far? Why? 

- How might 'discrete' context affect "hard science" systems, like physics?

## Johns (2006)

The Many Faces of Context:

- Salience of situational features

- Situational strength

- Cross-level effects     

- Bundle of stimuli

- Discrete events 

- Shaper of meaning


## Johns (2006)

Key Points 

- Context (where / when) can shape the relative importance of a theory compared to other effects

- It can serve as a **boundary of applicability** or can **condition theoretical effects**


## Makadok Burton and Barney (2018)

>Rather than introducing radical new “grand theory” para- digms, most theory contributions in strategic management extend, clarify, or apply received theories in new and interesting ways. Here we offer a guide on how to make these kinds of contributions to theory. Theory usually begins with a research question, which can come from the phenomenon of interest, variations/limitations of existing theory, or intellectual creativity. Along with the question, there are a number of more craftsmanship-level aspects of a theory where contributions can be made [...] (Abstract)

## Makadok Burton and Barney (2018)

Discussion Questions 

- Did you find this useful?

- Might this framework allow for an integration of theory and phenomena?

## Makadok Burton and Barney (2018)

Key Points

- There are many means by which theoretical contributions can be made

- Contributing to theory means **adding to our web of knowledge**, you don't need to spin the whole thing yourself

- Phenomena can provide new lenses to see how a theory operates and old theories can be useful in explaining new phenomena

# Lecture - Theory and phenomena

## Theory and phenomena: Two sides to a coin

- Theory: foregrounding the parts and **asking why**

- Phenomena: foregrounding the whole and **successfully taking action**

## Motivating example from high school physics

## Phenomenon - Making a free throw

Let's say we know exactly how much force we need to get the ball to travel from the free throw line to the hoop horizontally and our aim is dead straight.

But we don't know how much we need to loft the ball to make it in the basket. 

How do we solve for the height of the ball at any given time?

**Goal: We want to successfully take an action - making a free throw**

## Theory - Newton's second law

Newton says: The ball is being acted upon by the force of gravity, which imparts an acceleration.

$$a = g = -9.8 m/s^2$$

$$h(t) = h_0 + v_0t + (-9.8/2)t^2$$
Will we get the answer right??

**Goal: We want to understand - why does the ball move the way it does?**

## Aside - Turtles all the way down

Note this law is a mathematical expression between two quantities: the height of the ball and time. It doesn't say where the expression is coming from or what is causing it.

We can say it is due to gravity since this relationship holds for any object on Earth, and thus a common gravitational field for the Earth is consistent with this explanation.  Further, celestial bodies operate with similar mechanics.  

But where does gravity come from?

## Aside - Turtles all the way down

> A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the centre of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!"
- Steven Hawking, A Brief History of Time

## Context - Earth

- Why is $g = -9.8m/s^2 ?$

- What about air resistance?

- In both cases, the boundaries of the specific context are often captured by **parameters**

## Context matters!

[![](assets/feather and bowling ball.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E43-CfukEgs) 

## Aside: Theorizing 

How would we arrive independently at the conclusion about the force of gravity? 

$$a = g = -9.8 m/s^2$$

What observations would we need to make?

What data would we collect?

What would need to be true about the data generating process to get a solid answer?

## Let's generalize the example

- The phenemonon is a problem we want to solve or something "real" we want to understand (score points)

- We use theories to abstract away complexities and focus on core principles, which are often unobservable (the existance of gravity, and its effect)

- But we need to be mindful of the context in which those theories are applied to pin down the values of relevant parameters (air resistance, gravitational force) 

## Example phenomena of interest 

- Acquisition premiums paid 

- Likelihood of achieving an IPO

- Probability of bank failure

- Level of CEO overconfidence

## Explaining phenomena: The tricky bits 

- What theories are applicable? (There are many that could be)

- What might they omit and how do you deal with that? (What must be controlled for?)

- If you learn something in a particular context, how can you generalize?

- If theoretical contributions are a prerequsite to publish, how do you make one?

## Example theories of interest 

- Social network theory

- Transactions costs economics

- Theory of planned behavior

- Theory of constraints

## Extending theory: The tricky bits 

- Where can you find situations where the theory cannot be straightforwardly applied? (Potential limits?)

- Why are these situations worthy of study? (Importance of the findings?)

- How can you map the particulars of a theory into a specific context?

## Back to our logical modes

How it is "supposed to work"

- Induction: common themes across phenomena -> gives rise to theories

- Deduction: applying principles encoded as theories -> explains variation for a particular phenemonon

But when these steps are performed by different researchers who have difficulty understanding each other's processes (e.g., qualitative inductive work, quantitative deductive work), this process can short circuit

It can also short circuit if the interesting questions aren't raised to be examined inductively in the first instance 

## A third way: "Policy engineering" (my term)

Why not build models that synthesize theories to explain a phenomenon capitalizing on a bounded context where parameters are estimable?

- This could allow for an "engineering" orientation, where theories are rigorously applied to specific situations

Issues

- Unfortunately, nailing down parameters is (in my view, somewhat derisively) known as being "an empirical question"

- Yet without them, how can we make recommendations?

- My hunch: These are often unstable, putting primacy on theoretical directionality 

## Towards model building

Different foci, different **nomological networks**

- Theory-focused: Construct / relationship / proposition centric

- Phenomenon-focused: Variable / prediction / hypothesis centric 

# Nomological networks

## Key Thinking Tool: Nomological networks 

> Scientifically speaking, to "make clear what something is" means to set forth the laws in which it occurs. We shall refer to the interlocking system of laws which constitute a theory as a nomological network. - (@cronbach1955, p. 290)

## Key Thinking Tool: Nomological networks

## Theory-focused models

Objective: Make correct predictions across as many cases as possible (assuming other details rendered negligible) 

How: Build out the nomological network of the theory 

- Connecting more and more variables and hypotheses **across phenomena** to a core set of constructs, relationships, propositions

- Expanding upon the common core of constructs (who/what)

- Determining the mechanisms of actions and underlying causes (how, why)

- Identifying and pushing on the boundaries of applicability (where, when)

## Phenomenon-focused models

Objective: Make the best prediction for a specific case

How: Build out the nomological network of the phenemonenon (this is not how it is thought of in the literature) 

- Connecting more and more constructs and relationships **across theories** to explain a core set of variables

- Identifying the key variables at play and the context/parameters that matter (who/what)

- Determining how theories comport and conflict in the specific situation (how, why)

- Taking advantage of a specific bounds of a context to pin down predictions with precision (where, when)

 
## Which takes primacy?

Bacharach (1989) places primacy on generalizability - since theory "abstracts" away from variables to constructs to predict across more situations it is given a lofty status

But we could just as easily place primacy on predictive power - here a phenemenon "focuses" attention across theories to specific variables of interest


## Comparing theoretical and phenomological nomological networks

## Summary

To oversimplify a lot, here is my mental model:

- Phenomena specify a universe of dependent variables and independent variables to define a particular context

- Theories provide the "rules" for how a specific set of IVs and DVs interrelate across contexts

- But we also need **parameters** to capture differences across contexts

Here is one way I try to keep both in mind as I read papers: <http://briancfox.com/vfront/>

## Summary

Historically (in management) there was pressures for papers to "do it all" - advance and test a theory [@aguinis2014]

- As our readings indicate, this thinking slowly evolving towards a more nuanced view of contribution [@makadok2018]

- And @hambrick2007 noted, other fields have already found a more moderate stance 

- But many outlets still require a theoretical contribution in their editorial statements

- This requirement for a theoretical contribution is institutional, rather than intrinsic

## Finding the balance

> There  is  nothing  as  practical  as  a  good  theory - Lewin (1943), as cited in @mccain2015

- Theory provides a means to generalize our observations [@bacharach1989]

- But we need a place to make those observations in the first place [@hambrick2007]

- And we need to think about how our study can affect understanding of an important phenomenon [@tushman2007]

## Finding the balance

This balance can be struck within or across papers

- Within a paper: targeting a narrow question that takes seriously the phenomenon and focuses on modifying extant theory

- Across papers: some papers can focus on developing theory, others can build our understanding of the phenenemon

The rub: outlets vary in their receptivity to these different foci

- There is hope: publishing in more receptive disciplines, Academy of Management Discoveries, cross-over journals

- And you may be in a better position than most: Must you publish in top academic journals in Management?
