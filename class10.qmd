# The logic of mediation

## What is mediation?

> In all instances, mediational models advance an X -> M -> Y causal sequence, and seek to illustrate the mechanisms through which X and Y are related. [@mathieu2006]

## What is medition?

Nomological network view:

![](assets/mediator nomological network.png)
Regression model view:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2M + \epsilon$

$M = \beta_3 + \beta_{4}X + \epsilon_M$


##  Why mediation?

- Provides direct evidence for a theoretical claim

  - "We submit that inferences of mediation are founded first and foremost in terms of theory, research design, and the construct validity of measures employed, and second in terms of statistical evidence of relationships." [@mathieu2006, p. 1032]

  - Allows for assessment of causal effects via the front door criterion [@pearl2001, p. 81]
  
- Sophisticated tools allow for complex inferences

  - Establishment of direct and indirect effects for latent variables [@williams2009]
  
  - Partitioning of effects through multiple causal pathways
  
##  When is mediation appropriate?

Explaining "how" and showcasing mechanisms: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2M + \epsilon$

Partitioning total and indirect effects: Comparing effect sizes between $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2M + \epsilon$ and $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$

Transmitting the influence of instruments: $Innovation = \beta_0 + \beta_1(EquitySplits) + \beta_2(MembershipChange) + \epsilon$ ;  $MembershipChange = \beta_3 + \beta_4EquitySplit + \epsilon$

Isolating mechanisms through interventions:  $Light On = \beta_0 + \beta_1Power + \beta_2(Switch=on) + \epsilon$

# Performing a mediation analysis

## How do you perform a (basic) meditation analysis?

1. Articulate the theoretical justification for a mediational inference.

2. **Clearly** make your prediction as a hypothesis.

3. Run a sequence of regressions in line with your intended inference [@mathieu2006] and extract relevant effects

4. Perform statistical inference (t-tests, indirect effect tests)

5. Illustrate direct and indirect effects

## Deep dive: Articulate your theoretical justification

>In short, no statistical analysis can unequivocally differentiate one causal sequence from another. Theorists and researchers must then rely on other means to justify the sequence of effects. The most valuable bases to advance such inference come from: (1) experimental design features; (2) temporal precedence; and (3) theoretical rationales. [@mathieu2006, p. 1033]


## Deep dive: Clearly make your prediction as a hypothesis

It is critical when making an argument for mediation that you specify what you mean.  Following @mathieu2006, are you proposing:

- A full mediation, where the mediating variable fully captures the effect of the IV on the DV?

- A partial mediation, where the mediating variable captures, some but not all, of the effect?

- An indirect effect, whereby the IV only has an effect on the DV through its influence on the mediator?

## Illustrating a mediation: Indirect effects

![@ling2008](assets/example mediation.png)

## Things can get crazy (again)! 

- Multiple mediators (either in parallel [@ling2008] or in sequence)

- [Mediated moderation and moderated mediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics))

- As with complex moderation models, can you explain what you are doing?

## "Generalizing" mediation: SEM

I have given you two readings (@williams2009 and @ling2008) to help you dip your toes into the waters of structural equation model (SEM)

This is a fundamentally different way of looking at data, which seeks to compare an observed covariance matrix versus a "model implied" covariance matrix built from the relationships included or excluded from an SEM model (which can include a structural as well as a measurement model component)

The technique involves asking how many connections can be "pruned" without making the model fit worse - in other words, the more $\beta_i = 0$, the better!

## Alternative analyses

- Structural equation modeling (@williams2009)

- [Non-linear causal models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model) and [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) (@pearl2001)

- [Hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)
