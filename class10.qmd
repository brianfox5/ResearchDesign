# The logic of mediation

## What is moderation?

## What is moderation?

Nomological network view:

Regression model view:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z+ \beta_3XZ + \epsilon$

##  Why moderation?

##  When is mediation appropriate?

Explaining "how" and showcasing mechanisms

Partitioning direct and indirect effects

Transmitting the influence of instruments

Isolating mechanisms through interventions:  $y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1j}x + \epsilon_{ij}$; $\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + \nu_j$

# Performing a mediation analysis

## How do you perform a (basic) meditation analysis?

1. **Clearly** make your prediction as a hypothesis.

2. (Optional). Center and scale variables

3. Run regression with "main effects" only (including the moderator!)

4. Include interaction effects

5. Perform statistical inference (t-tests, $\Delta R^2$, F-tests)

6. Plot interaction and assess marginal effects

7. Run supplemental tests (e.g., tests of curvature [@haans2016], simple slopes [@dawson2014], regions of significance)


## Deep dive: Clearly make your prediction as a hypothesis

It is critical when making an argument for moderation that you specify what you mean.  Is it:

- A pre-existing (positive / negative) main effect will become (stronger / weaker) in the presence of the moderator?

- An (existing/null) effect will become (absent/present) in the presence of the moderator?

- The moderator has such an influence that it will flip the sign of the effect, depending on its level?

- Which is the main effect and what is the moderator?

- Will the moderator have an indepedent influence (i.e., a mean shift)?

## Illustrating a mediation: Indirect effects

## Things can get crazy (again)! 

Multiple mediators

Mediated moderation and moderated mediation

Again, can you explain what you are doing?


## "Generalizing" mediation: SEM

I have given you two readings (@hitt2007 and @wolfson2018) to help you dip your toes into the waters of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) / a.k.a. random coefficients modeling (RCM)

This can be viewed as a "generalization" of moderation, where slope coefficients (betas) and intercepts can not only be dependent on a third variable but may have their own *random distribution*

This technique allows you to naturally model nested settings [@hitt2007], but gets complicated quickly

## Alternative analyses

are there any?

# Applications

## Application readings
