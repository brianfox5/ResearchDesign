    "text": "Connections\n\nFalsifiability provides a basis for abductive reasoning pure deductive reasoning is true a priori if the premises and statements are valid. We can transform our understanding of the system but generate additional truths - we may uncover them.\nWe worry about the defensibility of our arguments to be able to act upon the conclusions with confidence\nBut our arguments and conclusions are irrelevant if they aren’t applcable to real-world problems; worries about inside baseball.\nFinally, the structure of our empirical base presumes that the research was performed in good order and that the findings are replicable within their domain of applicability. This gets to the idea of trust but verify and the need to construct “stylized facts” (Kaldor, 1957, 1961; Helfat, 2007)"
