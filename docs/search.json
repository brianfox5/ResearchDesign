Seminar participants will learn how to develop a research project and apply quantitative methods drawn from across the social sciences to achieve their aims.\n\n\n\nThis primary function of this course is to help advance your dissertation research. You will learn how to identify and articulate research questions, build models, develop hypotheses, and determine appropriate methods to address your research question. At a more granular level, my objectives are as follows:\n\nAcquaint you with the research process\nFacilitate your understanding of the management research context\nFamiliarize you with commonly employed quantitative methodologies and techniques\nDemonstrate the need for theory-empiric fit in high-quality management research\nProvide examples of specific research applications as toy models for your own work\nHelp you appreciate the subtle nature of research design\n\n\n\n\nIn support of these goals, we will employ the following format for the majority of our classes:\n\nPart I: Conceptual grounding and agenda setting (10 minutes)\nPart II: Core paper discussion (45 minutes):\n\nWe will discuss the 2-3 papers that all students have been assigned to read in detail\nThese papers typically will provide a mix of conceptual background and how-to guides\n\nBreak (5 minutes)\nPart III: Activity period (40 minutes):\n\n(Weeks 2 – 7) Compare / contrast: One group tasked with reviewing two additional papers to explain their points of intersection, divergence, and ties to core papers\n(Weeks 8 – 14) Replication: One group tasked with using data from one of my current or published papers to replicate analyses and show the class the process\n\nPart IV: Summative lecture on concepts (15 minutes):\n\nI will make a brief presentation to tie together and highlight key concepts\nElements missed in the general discussion will be given greater focus\n\nPart V: Open discussion (5 minutes)\nPart VI: Workshop (4 hours, in-person meetings only):\n\nThis is your opportunity to work with me and colleagues to advance your final project\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone must read all required materials prior to class. Each student is expected to fully participate. All material due should be completed on Brightspace or sent to my email, depending on assignment requirements. Details on these assignments can be found in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nTask\n% of Grade\n\n\n\n\nClass participation – paper discussions\n20\n\n\nCompare - contrast presentation\n15\n\n\nReplication presentation\n15\n\n\nConcept checks (2)\n10\n\n\nInterim work on proposal\n15\n\n\nFinal research proposal\n25\n\n\nTotal\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B includes a list of required readings for the topics that we discuss. Supplemental reading materials are available, too – I have omitted them from the reading list for your ease of reference, but I can send you a more complete version of the syllabus with the supplemental readings included if you are interested. I will also provide a number of good reference texts below – again, none are required for the purpose of this class, but some will be invaluable as you continue your research methods journey, depending on your areas of interest and focus.\n\n\n\n(Note: all provided for reference only, none of these texts are required).\n\n\n\nCreswell, J.W. 2009.

As part of this preparation, I recommend that you put together an outline for each reading that captures (the below are illustrative examples):\n\nkey points of the paper\nwhat insights you gained from reading the piece\nquestions to raise during the class\npoints of potential conflict between this work and others you have seen in the past\nconnections noted between this paper and others in the class and elsewhere\nspecific tools and techniques you can apply in the future (if applicable, will not always be the case)\n\nThe assigned readings for each week are provided in Appendix B.\nI will also have a few questions written down for each paper for us to consider in case we need to get the ball rolling on the discussion; we may or may not discuss those questions depending on the flow of the class.\n\n\n\nYou have been assigned a number (see the table at the end of this section for your assignment. Based on this number, you will be allocated to a group of students (see the “Deliverables” column in the Course Schedule above).\nCollectively, your group will work together to perform a deeper reading of the two articles bulleted under the “Compare/Contrast” section of the week’s reading. You will make a presentation regarding these two papers: their points of intersection and divergence, how they fit with the other readings assigned for the week, and their place within your broader understanding of management research to date.\nIt is expected that your group will lead a discussion of these concepts in class. During that period, I will take the role of an informed participant except in cases when I need to clarify points of potential confusion.\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, you have been assigned a number (see the table at the end of this section for your assignment). Based on this number, you will be allocated to a different group of students (please note that the group assignments differ from the compare / contrast presentations, so that we can mix up group composition).\nCollectively, your group will work together to re-analyze the data for an in-progress or completed paper of mine. The objective here is for you to get hands-on experience with using the analytical tools that support these analyses and report your experience to the class. The paper will be provided to you as part of the packet of readings.\nI can also provide your group with the underlying data to complete your analyses, on an as-needed basis. I am also happy to work with your group to walk through questions and concerns that you have in performing the assignment.\nIt is expected that your group will lead a discussion of this effort in class and to explain what went well, what didn’t go as well, and what analyses and conclusions of the paper you were able to replicate and which you could not.\n\n\n\nThere will be two “concept checks” during the course of the semester – they will be administered online, outside of class. They serve two purposes: a) identifying areas where I have not communicated concepts adequately, and b) giving you an incentive to keep up with the readings. The typical format is 10-15 multiple choice questions that call upon you to apply the lessons of the classes that we have covered up until that point.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring our first in-person meeting, we will have a workshop session about four hours long. For the first two hours or so, students will make a five-minute presentation about their research topic/idea for their dissertation. This can involve a few PowerPoint slides to help guide the discussion. It may be a broad topic or specific question; this will vary by student. The purpose of the presentation is to introduce this research to the class at the beginning of the seminar and to get you thinking about it. This will be graded by the presence or absence of your preparation for this session. The balance of the workshop will be group work to discuss and advance those research questions, where I will move from group to group to facilitate discussions.\n\n\n\nDuring our second in-person meeting, we will have another workshop session about four hours long. For the first two hours or so, students will make a five-minute presentation about the draft model that they will examine for their dissertation work that builds upon their research topic/idea. Again, this can involve a few PowerPoint slides to help guide the discussion. This will be graded by the presence or absence of your preparation for this session. The balance of the workshop will be group work to discuss and advance those research questions, where I will move from group to group to facilitate discussions.\n\n\n\nThis is your opportunity to submit a first draft of your paper to receive feedback from me and your colleagues. Our final workshop will be structured as two sets of working sessions where you will be working with two different classmates to review and advance elements your draft. I will be going from group to group in order to answer questions and get read-outs of progress from each group. My expectation is that you will have the “front end” of the paper (introduction, hypotheses) more progressed than the methods section given the order of the content we are covering in class. As for the content that should be coming together in this first draft, please see the discussion of the final deliverable below.\n\n\n\nYour final deliverable is a drafted introduction, model development, and methods section that supports the research model you seek to examine. The purpose of the assignment is twofold:\n\nto make forward progress on your dissertation work that incorporates some of the skills you have acquired during the course\nto apply and integrate the concepts and issues being studied in this course regarding quantitative research design and method. Ideally, this proposal, once converted to a complete paper, would be of publishable standard, either as a conference paper, or for subsequent submission to a peer-reviewed journal. In terms of the format, here is a suggested structure for you to follow:\n\nCover page (include a title, your name, and an abstract)\nIntroduction (2-4 pages)\nTheory and Hypotheses (5-10 pages)\nMethods (5-10 pages)\nI would encourage you to draw upon the existing empirical papers that you have read in this class and previous classes as models for how to structure these various sections, in addition to the explicit guidance provided in the readings from the course. To provide a few examples:\n\nLange and Pfarrer, (2017) [Week: Research III: Practices] provide some nice suggestions for how to structure introductions\nSuddaby (2010) [Week Elements III: Constructs and variables] shares guidance on how to make sure that your constructs are sufficiently articulated in your theory development\nMathieu and Taylor (2006) [Week Techniques III: Mediation] develops a checklist of steps to perform in order to draw particular mediational inferences and rule out alternative configurations\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me with questions as you work on this assignment. If a question comes to my attention that would be useful for the whole class to talk about, I will set aside time during the following session to discuss it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nName\n\n\n1\nShardul Wartikar\n\n\n2\nEd Wogan\n\n\n3\nLakia Rutherford-Sargent\n\n\n4\nConor Long\n\n\n5\nEsteban Lopez Meneses\n\n\n6\nKay Anifowose\n\n\n7\nNicholas Svizzero\n\n\n8\nIke Okonkwo\n\n\n9\nReuben Brefo Marfo\n\n\n10\nDan Berlin\n\n\n11\nEsel Shemmeri\n\n\n12\nYulu Du\n\n\n13\nKali Maltese\n\n\n14\nTammy Rose\n\n\n15\nScott Keaney\n\n\n16\nTarry Gutzmore\n\n\n17\nBryan Drake\n\n\n18\nCynthia Fernandes\n\n\n19\nRalph Faber\n\n\n20\nBooma Yandava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Dropbox link is available on Brightspace, which provides access to all of these readings by class, including book chapters (where applicable).\n\n\n\nPopper, K.

    "text": "It is expected that students will have done the assigned readings in advance and be prepared to discuss them. As part of this preparation, I recommend that you put together an outline for each reading that captures (the below are illustrative examples):\n\nkey points of the paper\nwhat insights you gained from reading the piece\nquestions to raise during the class\npoints of potential conflict between this work and others you have seen in the past\nconnections noted between this paper and others in the class and elsewhere\nspecific tools and techniques you can apply in the future (if applicable, will not always be the case)\n\nThe assigned readings for each week are provided in Appendix B.\nI will also have a few questions written down for each paper for us to consider in case we need to get the ball rolling on the discussion; we may or may not discuss those questions depending on the flow of the class.\n\n\n\nYou have been assigned a number (see the table at the end of this section for your assignment. Based on this number, you will be allocated to a group of students (see the “Deliverables” column in the Course Schedule above).\nCollectively, your group will work together to perform a deeper reading of the two articles bulleted under the “Compare/Contrast” section of the week’s reading. You will make a presentation regarding these two papers: their points of intersection and divergence, how they fit with the other readings assigned for the week, and their place within your broader understanding of management research to date.\nIt is expected that your group will lead a discussion of these concepts in class. During that period, I will take the role of an informed participant except in cases when I need to clarify points of potential confusion.\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, you have been assigned a number (see the table at the end of this section for your assignment). Based on this number, you will be allocated to a different group of students (please note that the group assignments differ from the compare / contrast presentations, so that we can mix up group composition).\nCollectively, your group will work together to re-analyze the data for an in-progress or completed paper of mine. The objective here is for you to get hands-on experience with using the analytical tools that support these analyses and report your experience to the class. The paper will be provided to you as part of the packet of readings.\nI can also provide your group with the underlying data to complete your analyses, on an as-needed basis. I am also happy to work with your group to walk through questions and concerns that you have in performing the assignment.\nIt is expected that your group will lead a discussion of this effort in class and to explain what went well, what didn’t go as well, and what analyses and conclusions of the paper you were able to replicate and which you could not.\n\n\n\nThere will be two “concept checks” during the course of the semester – they will be administered online, outside of class. They serve two purposes: a) identifying areas where I have not communicated concepts adequately, and b) giving you an incentive to keep up with the readings. The typical format is 10-15 multiple choice questions that call upon you to apply the lessons of the classes that we have covered up until that point.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring our first in-person meeting, we will have a workshop session about four hours long. For the first two hours or so, students will make a five-minute presentation about their research topic/idea for their dissertation. This can involve a few PowerPoint slides to help guide the discussion. It may be a broad topic or specific question; this will vary by student. The purpose of the presentation is to introduce this research to the class at the beginning of the seminar and to get you thinking about it. This will be graded by the presence or absence of your preparation for this session. The balance of the workshop will be group work to discuss and advance those research questions, where I will move from group to group to facilitate discussions.\n\n\n\nDuring our second in-person meeting, we will have another workshop session about four hours long. For the first two hours or so, students will make a five-minute presentation about the draft model that they will examine for their dissertation work that builds upon their research topic/idea. Again, this can involve a few PowerPoint slides to help guide the discussion. This will be graded by the presence or absence of your preparation for this session. The balance of the workshop will be group work to discuss and advance those research questions, where I will move from group to group to facilitate discussions.\n\n\n\nThis is your opportunity to submit a first draft of your paper to receive feedback from me and your colleagues. Our final workshop will be structured as two sets of working sessions where you will be working with two different classmates to review and advance elements your draft. I will be going from group to group in order to answer questions and get read-outs of progress from each group. My expectation is that you will have the “front end” of the paper (introduction, hypotheses) more progressed than the methods section given the order of the content we are covering in class. As for the content that should be coming together in this first draft, please see the discussion of the final deliverable below.\n\n\n\nYour final deliverable is a drafted introduction, model development, and methods section that supports the research model you seek to examine. The purpose of the assignment is twofold:\n\nto make forward progress on your dissertation work that incorporates some of the skills you have acquired during the course\nto apply and integrate the concepts and issues being studied in this course regarding quantitative research design and method. Ideally, this proposal, once converted to a complete paper, would be of publishable standard, either as a conference paper, or for subsequent submission to a peer-reviewed journal. In terms of the format, here is a suggested structure for you to follow:\n\nCover page (include a title, your name, and an abstract)\nIntroduction (2-4 pages)\nTheory and Hypotheses (5-10 pages)\nMethods (5-10 pages)\nI would encourage you to draw upon the existing empirical papers that you have read in this class and previous classes as models for how to structure these various sections, in addition to the explicit guidance provided in the readings from the course. To provide a few examples:\n\nLange and Pfarrer, (2017) [Week: Research III: Practices] provide some nice suggestions for how to structure introductions\nSuddaby (2010) [Week Elements III: Constructs and variables] shares guidance on how to make sure that your constructs are sufficiently articulated in your theory development\nMathieu and Taylor (2006) [Week Techniques III: Mediation] develops a checklist of steps to perform in order to draw particular mediational inferences and rule out alternative configurations\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me with questions as you work on this assignment. If a question comes to my attention that would be useful for the whole class to talk about, I will set aside time during the following session to discuss it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nName\n\n\n1\nShardul Wartikar\n\n\n2\nEd Wogan\n\n\n3\nLakia Rutherford-Sargent\n\n\n4\nConor Long\n\n\n5\nEsteban Lopez Meneses\n\n\n6\nKay Anifowose\n\n\n7\nNicholas Svizzero\n\n\n8\nIke Okonkwo\n\n\n9\nReuben Brefo Marfo\n\n\n10\nDan Berlin\n\n\n11\nEsel Shemmeri\n\n\n12\nYulu Du\n\n\n13\nKali Maltese\n\n\n14\nTammy Rose\n\n\n15\nScott Keaney\n\n\n16\nTarry Gutzmore\n\n\n17\nBryan Drake\n\n\n18\nCynthia Fernandes\n\n\n19\nRalph Faber\n\n\n20\nBooma Yandava"

From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way — an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction […]\n\n\n[Then,] there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it.

It is hardly surprising to observe that we all make inferences to a case (use deduction), inferences to generalizations (use induction), and inferences to explanations (use abduction). Thus, using reasoning types as labels to describe entire research designs is misleading. Instead, differences between research approaches, whatever they may be, are found not in the types of reasoning used but, rather, in how the three reasoning types are used in conjunction with one an other.

It addressed an extremely interesting issue that both academics and practicing managers would like to learn more about. The only problem: the presenters had no theory. So, we spent the entire session going through our collective mental catalogues of theories that might be invoked so that the project could proceed and have some prospect of publication. People were men- tioning theories I’d never heard of. We became frenzied, nearly desperate: “Good god, there must be a theory out there that we can latch onto.” - Hambrick (2007)"

It is hardly surprising to observe that we all make inferences to a case (use deduction), inferences to generalizations (use induction), and infer ences to explanations (use abduction). Thus, using reasoning types as labels to describe entire research designs is misleading.
