## Preamble

While I really dove into the weeds last class, I will be keeping it higher level for remainder of the "techniques" classes

# The logic of moderation

## What is moderation?

> In general terms, a moderator is any variable that affects the association between two or more other variables; moderation is the effect the moderator has on this association. @dawson2014

## What is moderation?

Nomological network view:

![](assets/moderator nomological network.png)


Regression model view:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z+ \beta_3XZ + \epsilon$


##  Why moderation?

- Solves a theoretical problem

  - Management research, like many other disciplines, is replete with theories suggesting that the relationship between two variables is dependent on a third variable [@dawson2014]

- New tools are available for modeling

  - Recent developments have proven to be more flexible and appropriate for multilevel data arrangements. Most notably, random coefficients modeling (RCM) has seemingly become the analysis of choice [@hitt2007]

  - And while moderation in linear regression is straightforward, it is not so simple for non-linear models like logit or probit where marginal effects are non-constant
  
##  When is moderation appropriate?

- Complementarities and substitution effects: $y = \beta_1PB + \beta_2Jelly + \beta_3PB*Jelly$ 

- Contextual differences: $y = \beta_1x + \beta_2D_{country} + \beta_3 xD_{country}$

- Structural breaks: $y = \beta_1t + \beta_2\delta + \beta_3\delta t$ 

- Difference-in-differences: $y = \beta_1\Delta + \beta_2\delta + \beta_3\Delta\delta$ 

- Curvilinear effects: $y = \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2$ = $y = (\beta_1+\beta_2x)x$

- Heterogeneous effects: $y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1j}x + \epsilon_{ij}$; $\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + \nu_j$

# Performing a moderation analysis

## How do you perform a (basic) moderation analysis?

1. **Clearly** make your prediction as a hypothesis.

2. (Optional). Center and scale variables

3. Run regression with "main effects" only (including the moderator!)

4. Include interaction effects

5. Perform statistical inference (t-tests, $\Delta R^2$, F-tests)

6. Plot interaction and assess marginal effects

7. Run supplemental tests (e.g., tests of curvature [@haans2016], simple slopes [@dawson2014], regions of significance)

## Deep dive: Clearly make your prediction as a hypothesis

It is critical when making an argument for moderation that you specify what you mean.  Is it:

- A pre-existing (positive / negative) main effect will become (stronger / weaker) in the presence of the moderator?

- An (existing/null) effect will become (absent/present) in the presence of the moderator?

- The moderator has such an influence that it will flip the sign of the effect, depending on its level?

- Which is the main effect and what is the moderator?

- Will the moderator have an indepedent influence (i.e., a mean shift)?

## Illustrating an moderation: Interaction plots

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Here is an example of an amplifying interaction, the moderator has a independent effect (shifts the curve up) and increases the slope of the main effect

## Illustrating an moderation: Interaction plots

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Here is an example of an "cross-over" interaction, the moderator has no independent effect (curves are centered at a common point) but the slope changes

The "extreme case" of a crossover interaction is when the X variable has no main effect across the whole population, but has a positive or negative effect depending on the level of the moderator

## Things can get crazy! Three-way interactions

Yes, you can test them (although statistical power becomes an issue).

But to be justified, you need to **explain** all of the various ways three variables can interact.

Let's keep it simple and say each variable is binary (0/1).  That is already $2^3$ possible combinations to consider and have a story for.

## Statistical v. substantive meaning 

- Statistical meaning - the coefficient is significant

- Substantive meaning - how is the pattern of results differs with or without the interaction included in the model

## "Generalizing" moderation: HLM / RCM

I have given you two readings (@hitt2007 and @wolfson2018) to help you dip your toes into the waters of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) / a.k.a. random coefficients modeling (RCM)

This can be viewed as a "generalization" of moderation, where slope coefficients (betas) and intercepts can not only be dependent on a third variable but may have their own *random distribution*

This technique allows you to naturally model nested settings [@hitt2007], but gets complicated quickly

## Alternative analyses

- Subsample analyses

- Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)

- Orthogonal polynomial regression 

- Contingency tables (cross-tabs)
