First, we examine theory-related issues that should be addressed before research design and measurement considerations. Specifically, we discuss how to make meaningful theoretical progress including the use of inductive and deductive approaches, address an important issue, and conduct research with a practical end in mind. Second, we offer recommendations regarding research design, including how to address the low statistical power challenge, design studies that strengthen inferences about causal relationships, and use control variables appropriately. Finally, we address measurement issues. Specifically, we discuss how to improve the link between underlying constructs and their observable indicators. Our review offers a checklist for use by researchers to improve research quality prior to data collection and by journal editors and reviewers to evaluate the quality of submitted manuscripts.},

The proposed matrix may be useful both for defining the necessary components of good theory and for evaluating and/or comparing the quality of alternative theories. Finally, a discussion of the way theories fit together to give a somewhat broader picture of empirical reality reveals the lines of tension between the two main criteria for evaluating theory.},

In the model comparison framework, the article illustrates the value of using likelihood tests to contrast alternative models (rather than the typical reliance on tests of significance involving individual parameters), and it provides code in the open-source language R to allow readers to replicate the results.

Researchers from macro- and micro-oriented domains tend to differentially use the frameworks and also use different analytic tools and terminology when using the same modeling framework. These differences have the potential to inhibit cross-discipline communication. In this review, we explore how macro- and microresearchers approach panel data with a specific emphasis on the theoretical implications of choosing one framework versus another. We illustrate how fixed-effects and random-effects models differ and how they are similar, and we conduct a thorough review of 142 articles that used panel data in leading management journals in 2017. Ultimately, our review identifies ways that researchers can better employ fixed- and random-effects models, model time as a meaningful predictor or ensure unobserved time heterogeneity is controlled, and align hypotheses to analytic choice. In the end, our goal is to help facilitate communication and theory development between macro- and micro-oriented management researchers.},

Methodological scholarship on the topic overwhelmingly advocates for empirical researchers to employ two-stage instrumental variable modeling, a recommendation we approach with trepidation given the challenges associated with this analytic procedure. Over the course of two studies, we leverage a statistical technique called the impact threshold of a confounding variable (ITCV) to better conceptualize what types of omitted variables might actually bias causal inference and whether they have appeared to do so in published management research. In Study 1, we apply the ITCV to published studies and find that a majority of the causal inference is unlikely biased from omitted variables. In Study 2, we respecify an influential simulation on endogeneity and determine that only the most pervasive omitted variables appear to substantively impact causal inference. Our simulation also reveals that only the strongest instruments (perhaps unrealistically strong) attenuate bias in meaningful ways. Taken together, we offer guidelines for how scholars can conceptualize omitted variables in their research, provide a practical approach that balances the tradeoffs associated with instrumental variable models, and comprehensively describe how to implement the ITCV technique.},

The discrepancy between the estimated value and the value indicating perfect fit has three sources: misspecification, error arising from theoretical parsimony in the description of the model (parsimony error), and sampling error. Misspecification, which represents a disparity between ``realworld'' relationships and relationships in the model, is the most important source of error for researchers. It cannot be accurately assessed, however, unless parsimony error and sampling error are taken into account. Parsimony error occurs in measurement models when secondary relationships are excluded. Secondary relationships are defined here as secondary factor loadings and error term correlations that have small values, no theoretical bases, and no substantive meaning. A simulation was conducted to examine the effects of parsimony error on perfect measurement models and to establish appropriate criteria for model fit when parsimony error is present.},

Two kinds of knowledge relevance are discussed---the value for end users such as managers in organizations, and the value for one's own or other academic subcommunities. We argue that the most important mission of Organization Science (OS) is to be a ``source'' journal for academic subcommunities in organization studies by attracting and publishing new theories and ideas that increase the varieties of knowledge about organizations.},

Yet, it is not obvious that organization theory has become more precise, more general, or more accurate as a result. The author argues that this is due to three difficulties that additional data cannot fully resolve: (a) researchers lack experimental control, limiting their ability to draw causal inferences, and are largely inattentive to the standards for valid quasi-experimental design; (b) organizations are more appropriately construed as tools rather than as natural objects susceptible to ``laws;'' and (c) the regularities underlying organizational dynamics change over time such that empirical generalizations that are true during one period may be false in a different period. I conclude by suggesting improvements to research practice that would enable organization theory to progress toward greater insights.},

With the emergence of evidence-based management, field experiments enable us to deliver the most actionable tools to practitioners. This review explicates the role of experimental control and randomization and enumerates some of the factors that mitigate field experimentation. It describes, instantiates, and evaluates true field experiments, quasi-experiments, quasi-fields, combo designs, and triangulation. It also provides practical tips for overcoming deterrents to field experimentation.

The Method's singular aim is theory building, especially with multiple cases and theoretical logic.

I begin with the influence of the 1980s, including grounded theorizing and case logic. Relying on exemplars, I illustrate the Method's defining features. I also address common misconceptions (e.g. types of data, number of cases, performance emphasis). These miss the Method's essence and imply a rigid template that does not exist. Instead, the Method's relatively few defining features enable a wide variety of research possibilities. I conclude with what I would write today like a richer palette of research choices, more emphasis on time, and flexible philosophy of science. Yet the core message of theory building would remain.},

This paper uses a critical realist perspective to highlight the ambiguity and error encouraged by postmodernism's commitment to a socially constructed ontology. Critical realism's ontology is offered as a more fruitful alternative. Labour process theory, specifically agency and structure, is used to demonstrate (i) that critical realism is not damaged by many common postmodern criticisms of agency and structure, and (ii) that, once interpreted through the prism of critical realism, there is no need to abandon this powerful analytical device.},

abstract = {AbstractResearch SummaryAlthough pre‐entry startup experience is widely recognized as a driver of innovation in new ventures, a core feature of new venture teams is that their membership is fluid. In this article, we theorize and test whether venture team membership fluidity incrementally explains new venture innovation. We also investigate and demonstrate that team fluidity conditions the impact of pre‐entry startup experience present at founding. Testing our hypotheses with a cohort of 440 new ventures tracked for 8 years, we find support for the model across a wide range of specifications. Our study advances current understanding of the relationship between pre‐entry experience and new venture innovation, as well as novel insights into the central but often overlooked role of team fluidity.Managerial SummaryNew ventures rely on innovations to establish a market presence and compete against established firms. Even though team members are an essential source of inspiration, ideas, and resources to foster innovation, teams often change substantially as the venture evolves. We ask the question---does modifying the make‐up of the team make it more likely that the venture can innovate? We contend that such change significantly shapes the cognitive and interpersonal processes by which team members contribute to innovations. Our results suggest that new ventures undergoing member change can boost innovation in three ways: adding new members to the team with relevant experiences, taking advantage of opportunities to pause and reflect upon team processes in the wake of change, and mitigating the disruptive effects of change.},

However, there is little guidance to help researchers choose between these variations to meet the specific needs of their studies. The purpose of this article is to illuminate the scope and value of phenomenology by developing a typology that classifies and contrasts five popular phenomenological methodologies. By explicating each methodology's differing assumptions, aims, and analytical steps, the article generates a series of guidelines to inform researchers' selections. Subsequent sections distinguish the family of phenomenological methodologies from other qualitative methodologies, such as narrative analysis and autoethnography. The article then identifies institutional work and organizational identity as topical bodies of research with particular research needs that phenomenology could address.},

This lack of invariance due to model identification creates the possibility that different analysts may reach different conclusions about a parameter's significance level even though they test equivalent models on the same data. The authors suggest that parameters be tested for statistical significance through the likelihood ratio test, which is invariant to the identification choice.},

Moreover, a movement towards introducing moderation to quadratic relationships has emerged. By reviewing 110 articles published in SMJ from 1980 to 2012, we identify several critical issues in theorizing and testing of these relationships for which current practice falls short. These include insufficient causal argumentation, incorrect testing, mixing up two different types of moderation, and not realizing that the curve can flip completely. For these and other issues, a guideline is provided which, when followed, may bring clarity to theoretical motivation and rigor to empirical testing.Managerial summary:Too much can be as bad as too little. Many relationships in strategic management follow an inverted U‐shaped pattern, where moderate levels of a strategy lead to optimal performance. To gain deeper insights into the conventional wisdom that too much of a good thing can be harmful to performance, we discuss how such relationships can be better theorized and tested based on a review of articles exploring U‐shaped relationships in Strategic Management Journal during 1980--2012. We identify several critical issues that require close attention and provide a guideline to further develop and validate this important managerial intuition.

Although such changes can raise concerns about validity, there has been little discussion of this practice in our literature. To estimate the prevalence and identify key forms of scale adaptation, we conducted two studies of the literature. In Study 1, we reviewed the descriptions of all scales (N = 2,088) in four top journals over a 2-year period. We found that 46\% of all scales were reported by authors as adapted and that evidence to support the validity of the adapted scales was presented in 23\% of those cases. In Study 2, we chose six scales and examined their use across the literature, which allowed us to identify unreported adaptations. We found that 85\% of the administrations of these scales had at least one form of adaptation and many had multiple adaptations. In Study 3, we surveyed editorial board members and a select group of psychometricians to evaluate the extent to which particular adaptations raised concerns about validity and the kinds of evidence needed to support the validity of the adapted scales. To provide guidance for authors who adapt scales and for reviewers and editors who evaluate papers with adapted scales, we present discussions of several forms of adaptations regarding potential threats to validity and recommendations for the kinds of evidence that might best support the validity of the adapted scale (including a reviewer checklist).},

abstract = {Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains, have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

While studies using grounded theory in management research are becoming more popular, these are often mixed with the case study approach, or they provide contradictory guidelines on how to use it. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear guide for researchers who wish to use grounded theory in exploratory studies in management research. To support this goal, the methodology's different terms and variations, as found in the literature, are also discussed. This study can support researchers using this methodology, but it is also useful for reviewers and examiners who wish to understand more about it and the different ways in which researchers have implemented it.},

Working from a critical realist perspective, we affirm the importance of falsification and verification efforts for progress in theory development. We advocate a four‐step approach for advancing theory testing that prioritizes identifying and testing for the presence and effects of hypothesized causal mechanisms, rather than solely focusing on correlational methods to jointly test the set of effects composing a theoretical system. Going beyond prior critical realist writings, we provide practical guidance for deploying established research methods to test management theories.

Survival data, where the primary outcome is time to a specific event, arise in many areas of biomedical research, including clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and studies of animals. Many survival methods are extensions of techniques used in linear regression and categorical data, while other aspects of this field are unique to survival data. This text employs numerous actual examples to illustrate survival curve estimation, comparison of survivals of different groups, proper accounting for censoring and truncation, model variable selection, and residual analysis. Because explaining survival analysis requires more advanced mathematics than many other statistical topics, this book is organized with basic concepts and most frequently used procedures covered in earlier chapters, with more advanced topics near the end and in the appendices. A background in basic linear regression and categorical data analysis, as well as a basic knowledge of calculus and the R system, will help the reader to fully appreciate the information presented. Examples are simple and straightforward while still illustrating key points, shedding light on the application of survival analysis in a way that is useful for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in biostatistics.},

We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.},

In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring the effects of potential interventions (also called ``causal effects'' or ``policy evaluation''), as well as direct and indirect effects (also known as ``mediation''), in both linear and nonlinear systems. Finally, the paper clarifies the role of propensity score matching in causal analysis, defines the relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks, and develops symbiotic tools that use the strong features of both.},

abstract = {A multitude of cyber-physical system (CPS) applications, including design, control, diagnosis, prognostics, and a host of other problems, are predicated on the assumption of model availability. There are mainly two approaches to modeling: Physics/Equation based modeling (Model-Based, MB) and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, there is a growing consensus that ML methodologies relying on data need to be coupled with prior scientific knowledge (or physics, MB) for modeling CPS. We refer to the paradigm that combines MB approaches with ML as hybrid learning methods. Hybrid modeling (HB) methods is a growing field within both the ML and scientific communities, and are recognized as an important emerging but nascent area of research. Recently, several works have attempted to merge MB and ML models for the complete exploitation of their combined potential. However, the research literature is scattered and unorganized. So, we make a meticulous and systematic attempt at organizing and standardizing the methods of combining ML and MB models. In addition to that, we outline five metrics for the comprehensive evaluation of hybrid models. Finally, we conclude by shedding some light on the challenges of hybrid models, which we, as a research community, should focus on for harnessing the full potential of hybrid models. An additional feature of this survey is that the hybrid modeling work has been discussed with a focus on modeling cyber-physical systems.},

abstract = {AbstractA considerable body of research utilizes large alliance databases (e.g., SDC, MERIT‐CATI, CORE, RECAP, and BIOSCAN) to study interorganizational relationships. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these databases is crucial for informing database selection and research design. In this study I conduct an analysis of five prominent alliance databases. Focusing on technology alliances (those formed for the purposes of joint research or cross‐technology transfer), I examine the databases' consistency of coverage and completeness, and assess whether different databases yield the same patterns in sectoral composition, temporal trends, and geographic patterns in alliance activity. I also replicate three previously published alliance studies to assess the impact of data limitations on research outcomes. The results suggest that the databases only report a fraction of formally announced alliances, which could have detrimental consequences for some types of research. However, the databases exhibit strong symmetries in patterns of sectoral composition, alliance activity over time, and geographic participation. Furthermore, the replications of previous studies yielded results that were highly similar to those obtained in the original studies. This study thus provides some reassurance that even though the databases only capture a sample of alliance activity, they may yield reliable results for many---if not all---research purposes. This information should help researchers make better‐informed decisions about their choice of database and research design. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this article, we review the history of the use of field experiments, discuss some of the reasons for their current renaissance, and focus the bulk of the article on the particular technical developments that have made this renaissance possible across four kinds of widely used experimental and quasi-experimental designs-randomized experiments, regression discontinuity designs in which those units above a cutoff get one treatment and those below get another, short interrupted time series, and nonrandomized experiments using a nonequivalent comparison group. We focus this review on some of the key technical developments addressing problems that previously stymied accurate effect estimation, the solution of which opens the way for accurate estimation of effects under the often difficult conditions of field implementation-the estimation of treatment effects under partial treatment implementation, the prevention and analysis of attrition, analysis of nested designs, new analytic developments for both regression discontinuity designs and short interrupted time series, and propensity score analysis. We also cover the key empirical evidence showing the conditions under which some nonrandomized experiments may be able to approximate results from randomized experiments.},

I highlight how self-selection on hard-to-measure or unobservable characteristics can bias strategy performance estimates and recommend an econometric technique that has been developed to account for this effect. Although this concern applies to a wide range of strategy questions, to demonstrate its effect I empirically examine if entry mode choice (acquisition versus greenfield) influences foreign direct investment survival. In specifications that do not account for self-selection, I find that greenfield entries have survival advantages compared to acquisitions. This confirms previous findings. However, the significance of this effect disappears once I account for self-selection of entry mode in the empirical estimates. The results confirm that estimates from models that do not account for self-selection of strategy choice can lead to incorrect or misleading conclusions},

abstract = {What makes a decision strategic? When is strategy most important? This paper formally studies these questions, starting from a (functional) definition of strategy as the smallest set of choices to optimally guide (or force) other choices. The paper shows that this definition coincides with the equilibrium outcome of a ``strategy formulation game,'' in which such strategy endogenously creates a hierarchy among decisions. With respect to what makes a decision strategic and what makes strategy valuable, the paper considers the effect of commitment, reliability, and irreversibility of a decision; the presence of uncertainty (and the type of uncertainty); the number and strength of its interactions and the centrality of a decision; its level and importance; the development of capabilities; and competition. This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy.},

abstract = {Many of today's global scientific challenges require the joint involvement of researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (social sciences, environmental sciences, climatology, medicine, etc.). Such interdisciplinary research teams face many challenges resulting from differences in training and scientific culture. Interdisciplinary education programs are required to train truly interdisciplinary scientists with respect to the critical factor skills and competences. For that purpose this paper presents the Methodology for Interdisciplinary Research (MIR) framework. The MIR framework was developed to help cross disciplinary borders, especially those between the natural sciences and the social sciences. The framework has been specifically constructed to facilitate the design of interdisciplinary scientific research, and can be applied in an educational program, as a reference for monitoring the phases of interdisciplinary research, and as a tool to design such research in a process approach. It is suitable for research projects of different sizes and levels of complexity, and it allows for a range of methods' combinations (case study, mixed methods, etc.). The different phases of designing interdisciplinary research in the MIR framework are described and illustrated by real-life applications in teaching and research. We further discuss the framework's utility in research design in landscape architecture, mixed methods research, and provide an outlook to the framework's potential in inclusive interdisciplinary research, and last but not least, research integrity.},

The goal of such analyses is to partition explained variance among multiple predictors to better understand the role played by each predictor in a regression equation. Unfortunately, when predictors are correlated, typically relied upon metrics are flawed indicators of variable importance. To that end, we highlight the key benefits of two relative importance analyses, dominance analysis and relative weight analysis, over estimates produced by multiple regression analysis. We also describe numerous situations where relative importance weights should be used, while simultaneously cautioning readers about the limitations and misconceptions regarding the use of these weights. Finally, we present step-by-step recommendations for researchers interested in incorporating these analyses in their own work and point them to available web resources to assist them in producing these weights},

abstract = {Business academics have focused their attention on empirical investigation of programs' effect on organizational competitive performance. These studies primarily emphasize theory building. With the many definitions of theory, academics are not certain whether their research papers meet the specific requirements for theory development required by the academic field of the philosophy of science. Certainly, supply chain academics generally believe that their academic articles fulfill the requirements of theory building. Although many of these articles do have elements of theory, more focus is needed on the specific requirements of theory to assure that academic research is ``good'' theory building. The primary purpose of this research paper is to logically develop a set of guidelines to assist empirical researchers to assure that their studies fulfill the requirements of good theory based upon traditional scientific theory building. By fulfilling the requirements of good theory, researchers will develop studies that will have a lasting impact on their academic field. To achieve a lasting impact on an academic field, it is necessary to follow a logical plan. This article provides a plan for logical guidelines for developing an understanding of how and why ``good'' theory building is achieved. This article logically develops a formal conceptual definition of theory along with its related properties to understand these guidelines. Next, it analyzes the requirements of theory, ``good'' theory, and their properties. These guidelines are included in the existing philosophy of science publications. However, this article consolidates these sources and logically explains why these guidelines are needed. In the conclusion, the guidelines are summarized to serve as a summary checklist for supply chain researchers to use for ensuring their articles will be recognized as a contribution to the academic field. So in that sense, this article does not develop a revolutionary new insight into theory‐building empirical articles, but rather integrates diverse traditional philosophy of science requirements into a much simpler set of guidelines. Through logical development of these guidelines, researchers will understand the structure of theory and how to ensure their studies can be modified to have a lasting impact on the field of supply chain management.},

Because assignment to the independent variables of observational data is usually nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we review the large literature produced primarily by statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades on the estimation of causal effects from observational data. We first review the now widely accepted counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal effects. After examining estimators, both old and new, that can be used to estimate causal effects from cross-sectional data, we present estimators that exploit the additional information furnished by longitudinal data. Because of the size and technical nature of the literature, we cannot offer a fully detailed and comprehensive presentation. Instead, we present only the main features of methods that are accessible and potentially of use to quantitatively oriented sociologists.},

abstract = {In traditional work contexts, factors such as individuals' general competencies are used to predict indices of their performance such as yearly performance appraisals. Whereas traditional approaches to predicting individuals' performance focus on differences between individuals, a considerable proportion of variability in performance is attributable to within-person sources. However, we submit that within-person variability in performance may also be attributable to the fact that people work in different contexts. Moreover, individual performance is often the result of unrecognized team contributions. Accordingly, we advance a Human Capital Resource Complementarity (HCRC) theory to explain the alignment of human capital resources with dynamic situational features, and to illustrate the influence of team collective competencies on the performance of individual members. We then empirically test HCRC theory-derived hypotheses using a sample of 169 cyclists from 22 teams across 18 stages of the centennial Tour de France. Our results suggest that individuals' specific competencies interact with situational characteristics to predict their performance variability over time, beyond that accounted for by their general competencies. Moreover, these effects are accentuated to the extent that teammates' competencies aligned with individual competencies in a given situation. Implications for future theory building, research, and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {The second edition of a comprehensive state-of-the-art graduate level text on microeconometric methods, substantially revised and updated. The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis. Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of ``generalized instrumental variables'' (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the ``generalized estimating equation'' literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain ``obvious'' procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

Six hundred ninety three English language scholarly journal articles published between 1945--2013, retrieved through a search of broad and specialized full‐text bibliographic databases as well as back issues of JASIS/JASIST using known variants of Lewin's Maxim, were categorized based on the text associated with the Maxim. Psychology, Management, and Education articles dominated the retrieval (∼70\%) while Information Science was essentially invisible. In successive 5‐year periods between 1989 and 2013, the proportion of Explicit Citations to Lewin's writings increased in all three subject areas, while the proportions of invocations of Lewin (attribution without citation) and Implicit Citations (use of the Maxim without attribution) varied from one period to the next; Lewin's influence appears to be increasing rather than being obliterated. The influence of Lewin's ideas in Information Science was not visible here but merits further exploration.},
