## Agenda

-   Spillover from last class (if needed, 20 minutes)

-   Conceptual grounding (10 minutes)

-   Core paper discussion I (30 minutes)

-   *Break*

-   Core paper discussion II (30 minutes)

-   Summative lecture on concepts (15 minutes)

-   Some thoughts on thinking if we have time (10 minutes)

# Conceptual grounding

## Last class - Some key principles of research design

-   Falsifiability: Can we modify our state of knowledge based on the result of our study?

-   Defensibility: Do our arguments appropriately employ modes of inference?

-   Applicability: Does our study actually impact the state of practice? 

-   Replicability: Will our work bear re-examination in a similar or new context?

## Today - Research design "positions"

We must ask ourselves for a given project where we stand regarding the following:

- The trilemma: generalizability, precision, and realism

- A related tension: rigor vs. relevance

- Conversation topic: what you want to say vs. what the audience wants to know

- What claim(s) to assert: stylized facts, assumptions, critiques, and omissions

## Huff (1999)

Writing for Scholarly Publication. SAGE. \[Chs. 1, 3\]

> The critical questions ot answer are these:

- *Which conversations should I participate in?*

- *Who are the important "conversants"?*

- *What are these scholars talking about now?*

- *What are the most interesting things I can add to the conversation? (p. 9)*

## Huff (1999)

Discussion Questions 

- Does the perspective of "conversation" resonate?  How does this relate to academic work progressing iteratively rather than linearly?

- How might you use this research diamond to inform your research question for this class?

> We use knowledge weaving as a metaphor for achieving that alignment: combining the warp of distinct knowledge claims (i.e., what content is significant) with the weft of their developmental status (i.e., how to advance that content). Without both ingredients, the researcher risks shoehorning a question into the focal literature without substance. (p. 2)

- How can a dual focus on knowledge claim type and developmental status help to position your study within the extant scholarly conversation?

# Summative lecture

## Defining a landscape for research questions

Dimensions we have discussed today: 

- To what end? Rigor (understanding) and relevance (use)

- By doing what? Precision, generalizability, and realism

- With whom? What matters to you v. what matters to others

- Means of advance? Types of knowledge claims and their level of development

## Defining a landscape for research questions

How might they be correlated with each other?

- Rigor and relevance: 

  - Orthogonal (r = 0?) 

  - In opposition (r = -1?)

- Precision, generalizability, and realism:

  - How do each map onto rigor and relevance?

## Defining your place on that landscape

- What matters to you v. what matters to others

  - What dimensions does your audience care about? 
  
  - Which do you care about and why? 
  
  - What implications does this have for topic selection? Outlet selection?
  
- A potential missing piece: Novelty?
  
## Defining your place on that landscape

- Types of knowledge claims and their level of development

  - How do different combinations of knowledge claims and development status fit on the research landscape?
  
    - Stable stylized facts: High in relevance, perhaps "old news" to scholars (Edison's quadrant?)
    
    - Unstable key assumptions: An opportunity to conduct basic research to build a new basis of understanding?
  
- How might your choice of knowledge claims define you as a scholar?

# Other thoughts

## Useful types of thinking when engaging in the research process

- Skeptical thinking

- Bayesian thinking

- Strategic thinking

- First principles thinking

## Skeptical thinking

> “Science depends on organized skepticism, that is, on continual, methodical doubting. Few of us doubt our own conclusions, so science embraces its skeptical approach by rewarding those who doubt someone else’s.”
― Neil deGrasse Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution

## Skeptical thinking

<!--- https://masterclass-notes.medium.com/summary-of-neil-degrasse-tysons-masterclass-on-scientific-thinking-and-communication-d55cba5a3843

> Skepticism is not outright rejection of something just because you don’t want it to be true or you don’t think it’s true. A proper skeptic questions what they’re unsure of, but recognizes when valid evidence is presented. 
― Neil deGrasse Tyson, Masterclass on Scientific Thinking and Communication

## Bayesian thinking

Implicit in the earlier discussions is our degree of belief.

- Nosek and Errington talk about how replication increases or decreases our degree of belief.

- Popper uses the asymmetry of verification to achieve binary outcome of disconfirmed evidence.

- But couldn't we be more subtle in our treatment of beliefs?
  
  - Indeed, we can through the application of Bayesian logic and Bayes' Rule.

  - I will not be teaching you the statistical methods that follow from this, but        you can find them.

## Strategic thinking

Finally, it helps to be strategic when thinking about designing and evaluating research.  By this I mean thinking that embraces three characteristics:

- Rigor

- Complexity

- Ambiguity

## Strategic thinking

- Rigor

  - Comprehensive – focusing attention on both the forest (a research program) and the trees (discrete methods or studies)  
  
  - Adaptive – balancing multiple goals and knowing what progress can be made against one or more of them simultaneously (McGrath's Trilemma)
  
  - Inferential – moving from what is known to what can be reasonably inferred (judicious use of multiple reasoning modes)

## Strategic thinking

- Complexity
  
  - Dynamics – accounting for first and second order effects that are material across actors, choices, and time (rigor)

  - Allocentricity – outcomes often jointly determined by internal and external factors, often other parties or agents 
  
  
## Strategic thinking

- Ambiguity
  
  - Unstable – non-linear shifts across time and situations may limit generalizability and heighten the role of context (thinking about whether findings will maintain relevance)
  
  - Unforeseeable – many research projects are a full reinforcement learning problem, learning while doing is necessary to reveal the evolving state of the world

## Strategic thinking

[![Bremmer's view of strategic thinking](assets/bremmer.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkgsYA-LYxo)

## First principles thinking

> A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further. Over two thousand years ago, Aristotle defined a first principle as “the first basis from which a thing is known.”
First principles thinking is a fancy way of saying “think like a scientist.” Scientists don’t assume anything. They start with questions like, What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven? 
- James Clear
