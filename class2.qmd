# Class 2: 

## Agenda

-   Conceptual grounding (10 minutes)

-   Core paper discussion (45 minutes):

-   *Break*


-   Compare / Contrast (40 minutes):

-   Summative lecture on concepts (15 minutes):

-   Open discussion (5 minutes)   

# Conceptual grounding

## Last class - Some key principles of research design

-   Falsifiability: Can we modify our state of knowledge based on the result of our study?

-   Defensibility: Do our arguments appropriately employ modes of inference?

-   Applicability: Does our study actually impact the state of practice? 

-   Replicability: Will our work bear re-examination in a similar or new context?

## Today - Some key tensions and choices for a research design

- The trilemma: generalizability, precision, and realism

- A related lens: rigor vs. relevance

- Picking a conversation topic: what you want to say vs. what the audience wants to know

- Asserting a knowledge claim: stylized facts, assumptions, critiques, and omissions

## Popper (2002)

The Logic of Scientific Discovery. \[Ch .1\]

> According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypoth- esis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction [...]

> \[Then,\] there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it. \[p. 9\]
