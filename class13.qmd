# Longtudinal designs

## What is a longitudinal design?

>Taking all the above into consideration, we define longitudinal research as research emphasizing the study of change and containing at minimum three repeated observations (although more than three is better) on at least one of the substantive constructs of interest. [@ployhart2009, p. 97]

##  Why are longitudinal designs useful?

> [S]trategy researchers have not fully capitalized on the fact that longitudinal data are multilevel in nature. Longitudinal data include two types of variance: within-unit (e.g., within-firm, within-person,
etc.) and between-unit (e.g., between-firm, between-person, etc.) variance1. These two types of variance correspond to two different relationships: within-firm and between-firm relationships. [@certo2017, p. 1536]


# How can you design a longitudinal study?

## A multitude of potential designs


## A basic workhorse setup: Panel data estimation



# Applications

## Application readings

Let's level-set people's familiarity with these pieces.
