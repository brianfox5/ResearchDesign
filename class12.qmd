# Quasi-experimental designs

## Preamble: Curve-fitting v. causality

Two different regimes: 

- Curve-fitting: Statistically identifying the parameters of a mathematical relationship between two or more variables based on the observed data, and making a law-like statement that summarizes empirical regularities

- Causality: Imposing further structure to impose an if-then logical sequencing; where a change in one variable will necessarily have a causal impact on the other.  Usually couched in terms of counterfactuals or "but for" reasoning: if not for the change in X, we would have observed a different Y 


## What is a "quasi-experiment"?

> A quasi-experiment is a study that takes place in a field setting and involves a change in a key independent variable of interest but relaxes one or both of the defining criteria of laboratory and field experiments: random assignment to treatment conditions and controlled manipulation of the independent variable [@grant2009, p. 655]

## What is a "quasi-experiment"?

"Natural experiments" as a form of quasi-experiment:

> Quasi-experiments also include changes to an independent variable that are naturally occurring rather than manipulated [@grant2009, p. 655]

## What is a "quasi-experiment"?

What about "regression discontinuity designs"?

> Regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) are sometimes also called cutoff-based designs. They assign units to conditions based on a cut- off score on an ordered assignment variable, with units that fall on one side of the cutoff receiving treatment and those on the other side receiving the comparison condition. [@shadish2009, p. 615]

## What is a "quasi-experiment"?

What about "interrupted time series" or "structural breaks"?

> Similar to RDD, an effect is measured as a change in the slope or intercept of the time series at the point of treatment introduction. [@shadish2009, p. 617]

##  Why are quasi-experiemental designs useful?

Per @grant2009, the benefits include but are not limited to: 

1. strengthening causal inference when random assignment and controlled manipulation are not possible or ethical; and

2. building better theories of time and temporal progression.


# Employing a quasi-experiement

##  What are the common threads among many of these designs?

Two groups: treatment and control 

- The amount of "randomness" differs across the designs

- The distinction between treatment and control also varies

##  What are the common threads among many of these designs?

Two+ time periods or comparison points: pre-/post or with/without treatment

- The period of followup before and after differs

- The "fuzziness" of the treatment can also vary

##  What are the common threads among many of these designs?

Accounting for covariates

- Random assignment is used to "wash out" differences between the groups

- Propensity scores and control variables used to account for residual differences

##  The aim: The experimental ideal

1. Experimenter intervention in selection of indepedent variable (treatment)

2. Random assignment to treatment and control group

3. Creation of a stark counterfactual: what would happen **but for** the treatment?

Assuming complications like "compliance" and other experimental design concerns are addressed, this allows for a clean determination of counterfactuals 

##  The aim: The experimental ideal

Per Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework [@angrist2008]:

$$E[y_{1i}|d_i = 1] - E[y_{0i}|d_i = 0] =$$
$$\pmb{E[y_{1i}-y_{0i}|d_i = 1]} + (E[y_{0i}|d_i = 1] - E[y_{0i}|d_i = 0])$$

- The LHS (top) is the difference between the treatment and control group in the population

- The bolded term is the "average treatment effect on the treated" - the causal effect that occurs for the treated group

- The RHS term in parentheses is the selection bias

##  The aim: The experimental ideal

$$E[y_{1i}|d_i = 1] - E[y_{0i}|d_i = 0] =$$
$$\pmb{E[y_{1i}-y_{0i}|d_i = 1]} + (E[y_{0i}|d_i = 1] - E[y_{0i}|d_i = 0])$$

The appeal of the experimental ideal is twofold:

1. We have a treatment and control group to estimate the LHS.

2. We use random assignment to set the selection bias term to 0.  

Taken together, this allows us to **identify** the causal effect of interest.  

# How can you design a quasi-experiement?

##  A potential second-best option: Difference-in-differences

Perhaps we can't get to the experimental ideal.

But let's say we do have a treatment and a control group that have been selected via a "natural experiment" (e.g., close elections, change in regulations, exogenous shocks) that helps us mitigate selection bias. 

We can track the change in outcomes over time for both groups and get a difference before the treatment $t_1$ (pre-treatment) and after the time of treatment $t_2$ (post-treatment).

We can then look at the difference-in-differences between these two groups to estimate the causal effect.

##  Estimating difference-in-differences

D-i-D as a comparison of means:
$DiD = (Y_{post,treated}-Y_{pre,treated})-(Y_{post,control}-Y_{pre,control})$

D-i-D in a regression framework: 
$Y = \beta_0+\beta_1T+\beta_2\delta+\beta_3\delta T$ 

where $\delta$ = 0 indicates pre-treatment and $\delta$ = 1 indicates post-treatment
and T = 1 indicates in the treatment group while T = 0 indicates the control group

In this setup, the estimated coefficient $\beta_3$ is the D-i-D estimator

##  Assumptions

There are many [assumptions to make the interpretation of a difference-in-differences casual](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/difference-difference-estimation):

![](assets/DiD estimators.png)

##  Selected comparisons to difference-in-differences

RDD: Does not require temporal differences, identification of effect through discontinuity in a continuous variable that determines placement in treatment group

Structural breaks: Does not have a contemporaneous control group, the assumption is that the existing trend would continue but for the structural break

Randomized field experiments: Closer to experimental ideal in principle but can be logistically challenging and faces hurdles of attrition, incomplete treatment , and Hawthorne effects

Lab experiments (e.g.,@shu2012 and countless OB lab studies): Closer to experimental ideal but there could be significant issues with external validity / generalizability beyond the lab setting
