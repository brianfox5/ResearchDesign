# Readings for Today

## Preamble

I have provided some discussion questions for us to consider in case we need to get the ball rolling. 

We may or may not discuss those questions depending on the flow of the class. 

In general, I would rather talk about your ideas and questions rather than these "canned" items.   


## Popper (2002)

The Logic of Scientific Discovery. \[Ch .1\]

> According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypoth- esis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction [...]

> \[Then,\] there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it. \[p. 9\]

## Mantere and Ketokivi (2013)

Reasoning in Organization Science. Academy of Management Review, 38(1), 70-89.

> Labels aside, a closer look at research practice reveals that researchers across research traditions use all three forms of reasoning. It is hardly surprising to observe that we all make inferences to a case (use deduction), inferences to generalizations (use induction), and infer ences to explanations (use abduction). Thus, using reasoning types as labels to describe entire research designs is misleading. Instead, differences between research approaches, whatever they may be, are found not in the types of rea soning used but, rather, in how the three reasoning types are used in conjunction with one an other. (p. 76)

## Nosek and Errington (2020)

What is replication? PLOS Biology: 1-8.

>To be a replication, 2 things must be true: outcomes consistent with a prior claim would increase confidence in the claim, and outcomes inconsistent with a prior claim would decrease confidence in the claim. The symmetry promotes replication as a mechanism for confronting prior claims with new evidence. Therefore, declaring that a study is a replication is a theoretical commitment. Replication provides the opportunity to test whether existing theories, hypothe- ses, or models are able to predict outcomes that have not yet been observed. Successful replica- tions increase confidence in those models; unsuccessful replications decrease confidence and spur theoretical innovation to improve or discard the model. (p. 2)

## Rynes and Bartunek (2017)

Evidence-Based Management: Foundations, Development, Controversies and Future. 

> Management academics have long noted a large gap between academic research and managerial practice. [...] Some have viewed the causes of the gap as lying primarily with academic researchers, who are characterized (perhaps caricatured) as having become overspecialized, self-referential, obsessed with theory, excessively mathematical, jargonladen, unconcerned about practical problems, and dismissive of practitioners [...] Others have focused on practitioners, who are sometimes characterized or caricatured as research phobic, anti-intellectual, susceptible to unproven fads and fashions...

# Summative lecture

## Preamble

What follows is my personal, idiosyncratic synthesis of the pieces that we have read to date. To be clear, many interpretations are possible due to these articles' collective:
  
- richness 
- overlap
- distinctive features

Furthermore, there are multiple plausible criteria to judge quality research and a lack of universal consensus given the multiplicity of aims and epistemological orientations

This is not to say anything goes; rather, I am trying to highlight the limits of my knowledge and my unique lens that necessarily abstracts away features from complex topics.  

## Some key principles of research design

-   Falsifiability

-   Defensibility

-   Applicability

-   Replicability


## Falsifiability

-   Falsifiability provides a basis for to use abductive reasoning to augment pure deductive reasoning.  The latter is true a priori if the premises and statements are valid. Thus, pure deduction an transform our understanding of the system, but cannot generate truth from outside the established system - this must be uncovered by other means. 

## Falsifiability

> My proposal is based upon an asymmetry between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements. 
- @popper2002 [p. 19]

## Defensibility

- If the logist of our arguments are defensible and the evidentiary basis is sound, we are better able to act upon the conclusions with confidence. 

- We rely on multiple modes of inference to assert our claims credibility - my coauthors and I argue that the relative importance of each depends on the type of research design employed and intended contribution.

## Defensibility

![The relative importance of inference modes by type of research design](assets/Simsek and Fox WIP.png){#fig-defensibility}

## Defensibility

One way to map out the defensibility of an argument is with a Toulmin diagram:

[![A Tolumin argument structure](assets/toulmin.png)](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/historical_perspectives_on_argumentation/toulmin_argument.html)

## Applicability

But our arguments and conclusions, even if correct, are irrelevant if they aren't applicable to real-world problems.

There are two corollaries to this:

- We should pick problems that actually matter, not just intellectual curiousities.

- We should not be hamstrung by our ability to tackle important problems. 

## Applicability

> I was recently at a brown-bag seminar where a pair of management colleagues were seeking advice about a preliminary research idea. It took just a few minutes for us all to agree that their research ques- tion was fascinating. It addressed an extremely in- teresting issue that both academics and practicing managers would like to learn more about. The only problem: the presenters had no theory. So, we spent the entire session going through our collec- tive mental catalogues of theories that might be invoked so that the project could proceed and have some prospect of publication. People were men- tioning theories I’d never heard of. We became frenzied, nearly desperate: “Good god, there must be a theory out there that we can latch onto.” 
- @hambrick2007


## Replicability 

-   Finally, the structure of our empirical base presumes that the research was performed in good order and that the findings are replicable within their domain of applicability. 

## Replicability 

> [A]n accumulation of evidence that points to empirical regularities provides us with a much broader and more generalized understanding of the world. Such empirical regularities are known as ‘stylized facts’. 
- @helfat2007

## The relative importance of each principle

We can consider four basic "classes" of research in management: 

- basic disciplinary research (primary studies in AER, AJS)

- applied research conducted in a management context (primary studies in AMJ)

- data-driven decision making derived from primary studies (systematic reviews in IJMR, JOM)

- practitioner-focused outlets (articles in HBR, CMR, popular press)

Where might, for example, applicability be more highly valued?  Falsifiability?


## Other thoughts: Useful types of thinking when conducting research

- Skeptical thinking

- Bayesian thinking

- Strategic thinking

## Skeptical thinking

> “Science depends on organized skepticism, that is, on continual, methodical doubting. Few of us doubt our own conclusions, so science embraces its skeptical approach by rewarding those who doubt someone else’s.”
― Neil deGrasse Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution

## Skeptical thinking

[![Skepticism as weighing evidence](assets/skepticism.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io6QdGcoWMU)


<!--- https://masterclass-notes.medium.com/summary-of-neil-degrasse-tysons-masterclass-on-scientific-thinking-and-communication-d55cba5a3843

> Skepticism is not outright rejection of something just because you don’t want it to be true or you don’t think it’s true. A proper skeptic questions what they’re unsure of, but recognizes when valid evidence is presented. 
― Neil deGrasse Tyson, Masterclass on Scientific Thinking and Communication

## Bayesian thinking

Implicit in the discussions above is a question of degree of belief.

- Nosek and Errington talk about how replication increases or decreases our degree of belief.

- Popper uses the asymmetry of verification to achieve binary outcome of disconfirmed evidence.

- But couldn't we be more subtle in our treatment of beliefs?
  
  - Indeed, we can through the application of Bayesian logic and Baye's Rule.

  - I will not be teaching you the statistical methods that follow from this, but        you can find them.

## Strategic thinking

Finally, it helps to be strategic when thinking about designing and evaluating research.  By this I mean thinking that embraces three characteristics:

- Rigor

- Complexity

- Ambiguity

## Strategic thinking

- Rigor

  - Comprehensive – focusing attention on both the forest (a research program) and the trees (discrete methods or studies)  
  
  - Adaptive – balancing multiple goals and knowing what progress can be made against one or more of them simultaneously 
  
  - Inferential – moving from what is known to what can be reasonably inferred


## Strategic thinking

- Complexity
  
  - Dynamics – accounting for first and second order effects that are material across actors, choices, and time

  - Allocentricity – outcomes often jointly determined by internal and external factors, often other parties or agents 
  
  
## Strategic thinking

- Ambiguity
  
  - Unstable – non-linear shifts across time and situations may limit generalizability and heighten the role of context
  
  - Unforeseeable – many research projects are a full reinforcment learning problem, learning while doing is necessary to reveal the evolving state of the world
