## A little about you

Please remember to fill out your introductory [Qualtrics survey](https://bentley.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_erJWo8SYdrte2p0) so that I can learn a  bit about you and your goals for the class!

Today, let's level set on your familiarity with some key ideas: [Pollev.com/drfox](https://PollEv.com/drfox)

##  Syllabus and materials overview

-   [Syllabus](https://briancfox.com/ResearchDesign/docs/syllabus.html)
-   [Brightspace](https://brightspace.bentley.edu)
-   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ny0hiyu93bep31udth6ot/h?rlkey=or2mfwzqbdzkwbv8ky4yws5h7&dl=0)

## Typical class flow

-   *Part I:* Conceptual grounding and agenda setting

-   *Part II:* Core paper discussion

    -   We will discuss the 2-3 papers that all students have been assigned to read in detail

    -   These papers typically will provide a mix of conceptual background and how-to guides
    
-   *Break* 

## Typical class flow

-   *Part III:* Activity period

    -   (Weeks 2 -- 7) Compare / contrast: One group tasked with reviewing two additional papers to explain their points of intersection, divergence, and ties to core papers

    -   (Weeks 8 -- 14) Replication: One group tasked with using data from one of my current or published papers to replicate analyses and show the class the process

## Typical class flow

-   *Part IV:* Summative lecture on concepts

    -   I will make a brief presentation to tie together and highlight key concepts

    -   Elements missed in the general discussion will be given greater focus
  

# Readings for Today

## Preamble

I have provided some discussion questions for us to consider in case we need to get the ball rolling. 

We may or may not discuss those questions depending on the flow of the class. 

In general, I would rather talk about your ideas and questions rather than these "canned" items.

2.  Mantere, S., & Ketokivi, M. 2013. Reasoning in Organization Science. Academy of Management Review, 38(1), 70-89.

4.  Rynes, S. L., & Bartunek, J. M. (2017). Evidence-Based Management: Foundations, Development, Controversies and Future. Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 4(1), 235-261. 

## Popper (2002)

The Logic of Scientific Discovery. \[Ch .1\]

> According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way — an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction [...]

> \[Then,\] there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it. \[p. 9\]


## Popper (2002)

## Mantere and Ketokivi (2013)

Reasoning in Organization Science. Academy of Management Review, 38(1), 70-89.

> Labels aside, a closer look at research practice reveals that researchers across research traditions use all three forms of reasoning. It is hardly surprising to observe that we all make inferences to a case (use deduction), inferences to generalizations (use induction), and inferences to explanations (use abduction). Thus, using reasoning types as labels to describe entire research designs is misleading. Instead, differences between research approaches, whatever they may be, are found not in the types of reasoning used but, rather, in how the three reasoning types are used in conjunction with one an other. (p. 76)

## Nosek and Errington (2020)

What is replication? PLOS Biology: 1-8.

>To be a replication, 2 things must be true: outcomes consistent with a prior claim would increase confidence in the claim, and outcomes inconsistent with a prior claim would decrease confidence in the claim. The symmetry promotes replication as a mechanism for confronting prior claims with new evidence. Therefore, declaring that a study is a replication is a theoretical commitment. Replication provides the opportunity to test whether existing theories, hypotheses, or models are able to predict outcomes that have not yet been observed. (p. 2)

## Nosek and Errington (2020)

Discussion Questions 

- Do you agree with their definition of replication?  
  
- How does this fit in with the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)?

## Rynes and Bartunek (2017)

Evidence-Based Management: Foundations, Development, Controversies and Future. 

> Management academics have long noted a large gap between academic research and managerial practice. [...] Some have viewed the causes of the gap as lying primarily with academic researchers, who are characterized (perhaps caricatured) as having become overspecialized, self-referential, obsessed with theory, excessively mathematical, jargonladen, unconcerned about practical problems, and dismissive of practitioners [...] Others have focused on practitioners, who are sometimes characterized or caricatured as research phobic, anti-intellectual, susceptible to unproven fads and fashions... (p. 236)
