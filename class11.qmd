# The perils of endogeneity

## What is endogeneity?

> Endogeneity arises when a regressor is correlated with the error term, thereby violating the most important OLS estimation assumption, the exogeneity condition, specifying that u has an expected value of 0. [@bascle2008, p. 288]

## What is endogeneity?

Nomological network view:

![](assets/endogeneity nomological network.png)

Regression model view:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$; $E[\epsilon|X \ne 0]$

##  Why is endogeneity problematic?

- A theoretical problem

  - We fail to capture the underlying dynamics of the process
  
  - We draw the wrong conclusions from our analyses about which variables matter or the direction of causal flow
  
- An empirical problem

  - We cannot recover causal effects due to a lack of ["identification"](http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-P/wp957.pdf)
  
  - We may not even be able to come up with estimates at all if the model is structurally unidentified (e.g., supply and demand models)
  
  - Our effect estimates can be **significantly** biased, and even in the wrong direction without correction

## What issues can cause endogeneity?

![](assets/catalog of endogeneity problems.png)

## What issues result in endogeneity?

1. Unobserved heterogeneity: Individual idiosyncratic deviations from the overall mean of the DV in a manner that is correlated with the IVs  (e.g., firm "quality" likely correlates with size)

2. (Observed) omitted variable: We have left out an observable variable (omitted variable, OV) that is correlated with the IV and DV (e.g., OV = average temperature, IV = gunshots, DV = ice cream sales)

3. (Unobserved) omitted variable: We have left out an unobservable variable that is correlated with the IV and DV (e.g., IV = study hours, DV = GPA, OV = g (general mental ability))

## What issues result in endogeneity?

4. Simultaneous / reverse causality: either we have the direction of causality wrong (Y -> X) or they cause each other / are codetermined (X <-> Y) (e.g., price and quantity in a market setting)

5. Non-random selection in groups: Individuals self-select into a state or treatment or there are differences in surivival or attrition (e.g., IV = hospitalization, DV = general health, selection effect = need for treatment)

6. Measurement error in X: We cannot measure X perfectly, which at a minimum [attenuates the relationship between X and Y](), but if the measurement error in X is correlated with Y, we come back to the omitted variable bias problem

## How can you correct for endogeneity?

**Approach 1: Isolate exogenous variation in X**

- Instrumental variables (IV) / Two stage least squares (2SLS): Can address all of these issues, but finding relevant and exogenous instruments is tough [@bascle2008] 

- Heckman selection / Tobit-2 / Tobit-5 models: Can address (5), possible to perform using functional form alone but stronger when with an [exclusion condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckman_correction) (i.e., an instrumental variable)

## How can you correct for endogeneity?

**Approach 2: Excise or extract endogenous elements from e**

- Include omitted variables: Can address (2), the essence of adding control variables to a model [@carlson2012]

- Fixed effects panel specifications: Can address (1),(2),(3) if the OVs are [time invariant], but can exacerbate (6) [@bascle2008]

- Dynamic model specifications: Can address (4), but caution required since this can introduce other endogeneity problems, especially with panel data (known as the [Nickell bias](http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-C/S2013/823/EC823.S2013.nn05.slides.pdf))

## How can you correct for endogeneity?

**Approach 3: Punt on fixing and instead assess threat to inference**

- Impact Threshold of Confounding Variables [(ITCV)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01492063211006458) and Robustness of Inference to Replacement (RIR) ask the question: How big of a confounding effect would an endogeneous problem need to have to overturn the inference in a model where it is not modeled?

- This can be a nice tool to have in the back pocket for reviewers 

# Analyzing data in the presence of endogeneity

## How do you perform a (basic) endogeneity analysis?

1. Proactively identify the potential cause(s) of endogeneity.

2. Run your models in a typical fashion.

3. Run alternative models (discussed above) that are consistent in the presence of endogeneity (example of 2SLS on next slide).

4. Use appropriate tests to determine which model is preferred (e.g., Durbin-Wu-Hausman, exogeneity, relevance tests). [@bascle2008]

5. Perform typical statistical inference based on the preferred model. 

6. It often helps to report test statistics, and space permitting, the results from alternative models to give the reader confidence in the robustness of the results.

## Example: Running 2SLS

1. **(Hard part)** Find instrument(s) for each of your endogenous variables.

2. If you are lucky enough to have an embarrassment of riches with multiple instruments for each, use them so you can test for exogeneity!

3. Verify the instruments are sufficiently strong (e.g., first stage F test)

4. Run the 2SLS procedure (next slide)

## Example: Running 2SLS

[What is 2SLS doing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation) In essence, the following[^1]: $Y = \beta \hat X + e$

Such that: $\hat X =  W\hat\delta$

And $\hat\delta = (W^TW)^{-1}W^TX$

Where W is the set of the exogenous variables + instruments, and X is set of exogenous and (instrumented) endogenous variables.

This procedure "purges" X of its endogenous part and only relies on the **exogenous variation** present in W. 

[^1]: Don't run this yourself since the standard errors will be wonky!  Use the output from the software which makes the necessary corrections. Also note that in regular OLS, X "instruments" for itself.


## Why not just use the models robust to endogeneity always?

- Multiple endogeneity issues: each may require non-compatible solutions.

- No free lunch: models robust to endogeneity pay a price (typically small-sample bias and efficiency).

- Many endogeneity tests compare two estimators - one that accounts for endogeneity and one that does not.

- If the test fails, endogeneity is a problem and you need to use the estimator that is "consistent" in the presence of endogeneity.

- If the test passes, it is better to use the 'standard' estimator: it is has more power and is more precise (tighter sampling distribution).
